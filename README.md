# DNA Compression and Decompression Tool

## Overview
This tool provides functionality for compressing and decompressing DNA sequences using a binary encoding scheme. It is capable of encoding a DNA string (consisting of the characters 'A', 'T', 'C', 'G') into a series of integers and then decoding it back to the original DNA string.

## Features
- **Compression**: Converts a DNA string into a series of integers.
- **Decompression**: Reconstructs the DNA string from the series of integers.
- **Binary Encoding**: Efficient 2-bit representation for each DNA base.
- **Command Line Interface**: Easy to use command line arguments for compression and decompression.

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (C++11 or later)
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Installation
Clone this repository or download the source code. Compile the program using:
$ make run
